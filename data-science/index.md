The goal of this group, upon gaining prerequisite knowledge through Core or on
your own, is to work with real problems and constraints using data science
methods to solve them. If you don't have the experience, no problem! While this
program may prove challenging to you, every member has the benefit of being on a
project team with 3-4 other members.

Students will find themselves actively engaging with projects geared towards
their interests as well as working with Kaggle competitions and datasets
provided by us. At the end of the semester, teams will present their findings
on the project they've taken on. Big or small, we want you to walk away with
unique experience that prepares you even more for research or industry.
