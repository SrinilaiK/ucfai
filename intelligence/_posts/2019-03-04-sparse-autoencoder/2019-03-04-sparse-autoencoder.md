  "Summary: These notes describe the sparse autoencoder learning algorithm, which is one approach to automatically learn features from unlabeled data. In some domains, such as computer vision, this approach is not by itself competitive with the best hand-engineered features, but the features it can learn do turn out to be useful for a range of problems (including ones in audio, text, etc)."
