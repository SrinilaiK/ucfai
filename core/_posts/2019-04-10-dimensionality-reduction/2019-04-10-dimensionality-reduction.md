  "Most of the interesting data that exist have an extremely large number of features which describe them. While this is functional for Neural Networks, this isn't useful for other, more descriptive models. Plus, sometimes you just want to visualize the most important data you have to see if there's any visual intuition. To do that, we need "dimensionality reduction techniques" like PCA (Principle Components Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), among many others. This  gives us the ability to extract the most necessary features of our data â€“ which will typically give us enough to initially do well!"
