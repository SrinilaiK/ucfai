Our custom lecture series designed to educate newcomers and those looking
to supplement their studies of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning!
Here we provide you with intuitions and practical understandings â€“ enabling
you to apply what you learn to research, industry, and your own projects.

The goal of this course is to dip your toes into a variety of topics and prepare
you to move into the other, more advanced, groups soon after. **We expect you to
attend as many lectures as possible and chunk out a few hours &ndash; roughly 
5-10 every week in addition to these meetings &ndash; to become successful.**

The material here has been a part of the core of AI@UCF since Felix Sosa, John
Muchovej, and Richard DiBacco reworked the structure of the club at UCF. As the
university doesn't to provide such coursework until your final semesters in degree
programs, this was created to function as a stand-in, to cultivate your skillset
for research and industry before you graduate.
