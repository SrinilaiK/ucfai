## Briefly

I'm one of the founders of AI@UCF and I've done research across quite a bit of Machine
Learning. I've since transitioned to working at the intersection of Computer Science
and Cognitive Science, building computational models that are able to do tasks that we
see children and young humans able to do, trying to work out some of the computational
basis of discussions.

## Founding AI@UCF

Following a summer of machine learning in 2016, I co-founded AI@UCF with
{{< mention flxsosa >}}. We started the group out of a desire to teach and noticing a
lack of accessible material to undergrads at UCF. We set out to build a course that even
first-year students could access and begin their journey in machine learning, data
science, and cognitive science.

## Since Founding

While teaching and building AI@UCF, I hopped around some labs, mentored at Udacity, and
picked up freelance work (via Toptal) focused on Computer Vision and Natural Language
Processing. The labs I hopped around were the Center for Research in Computer Vision
with Mubarak Shah and the Natural Language Processing Group with Fei Liu. I also spent a
summer at MIT in the MSRP-Bio Program, hosted at the Center for Brains, Minds, and
Machines at MIT, where I worked in Computational Cognitive Science, focused on Social
Cognition.

## Since Graduating

Following that fateful summer, I've returned to MIT as a Research Assistant. I'm still
freelancing at Toptal. And now I'm advising AI@UCF on further fleshing out `core` and
`discussions` &ndash; I also pop back from time-to-time to give guest lectures.
