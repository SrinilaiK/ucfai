I am a graduate student at the University of Miami working in the lab of Dr. Odelia Schwartz since the Fall of 2018. My main research interests are computational neuroscience, vision, and machine learning. Some central themes of my projects have included efficient coding, sparse coding, vector quantization methods, and information theory.
