Hi I’m Justin, a senior majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Intelligent Robotic Systems and Mathematics. I’m the current president of Artificial Intelligence at UCF, a student leader of eli^2, and one of the founders of Streats, a food truck startup started right at UCF. I’ve also been involved in organizations such as CEO Knights, Association for Computing Machinery, and American Society for Mechanical Engineers.\
\
During my involvement at UCF, I’ve pushed for inter-club relations and networking through student initiatives and eli^2. While I’m not currently involved in an internship or research laboratory, I spend a lot of time with students in the community, volunteering as a martial arts instructor and inspiring young kids in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. In my free time, I focus on spending time with my family and friends, hiking, fishing, and traveling to new places.
