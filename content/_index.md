{{< details summary="**Which group should I join?**" >}}
A great question! Here's a list of words to help you gauge your understanding background:

- machine learning
- artificial intelligence
- data science
- cognitive science

If you're **completely unfamiliar** with those, [Core]({{< ref "core" >}}) _and_
[Supplementary]({{< ref "supplementary" >}}) should be on your list of meetings to
check-out!
If you're **somewhat familiar**, but don't feel like you have mastery, then you should
definitely head over to [Core]({{< ref "core" >}}) so you can check and develop that
understanding!
If you're interested in **getting into research**, or _are a researcher_, you should
check out [Intelligence]({{< ref "intelligence" >}})!
