  Welcome to our first GBM meeting! This meeting will be heavily discussion-based,
  talking about a variety of interesting AI ethical issues like use in medical fields,
  politics, laws limiting AI, consciousness, and creating "human" AI. This is a great
  way to dip your toes into a field of AI many people often joke about or just say
  "AI
  will take over the world." Can our society properly regulate and use AI in the future?
  Come and discuss the answers to this question!
