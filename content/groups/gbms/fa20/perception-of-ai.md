abstract: >-
  Ever watch a TV show or movie that depicts robots taking over the world? In
  this meeting, we'll discuss how different forms of media perceive AI, from movies
  to news outlets to global tech experts. We'll also be clearing up misconceptions
  about the future of artificial intelligence (hint - robots are NOT taking over
  the world).
