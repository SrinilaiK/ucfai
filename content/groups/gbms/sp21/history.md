  Whether it be self-driving cars, facial recognition, or virtual assistants,
  artificial intelligence seems to be making its way into nearly every aspect
  of our society.  With AI's migration from just science fiction into the real
  world, one might wonder how we got here, or where was the "hype" ten to twenty
  years ago? In this meeting, AI@UCF will delve into the history of AI, uncovering
  the major figures and milestones that led us to where we are today.
