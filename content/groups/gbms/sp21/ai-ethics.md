  Welcome to our first GBM meeting! This meeting will be heavily discussion-based,
  talking about a variety of interesting AI ethical issues like use in medical
  fields, politics, laws limiting AI, consciousness, and creating "human" AI.
  This is a great way to dip your toes into a field of AI many people often joke
  about or just say "AI will take over the world." Can our society properly regulate
  and use AI in the future? Come and discuss the answers to this question!
