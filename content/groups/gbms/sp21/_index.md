  Our general body meetings (GBMs) is for those from all backgrounds and knowledge
  levels. In this group we explore the field of AI through discussion based meetings
  about ethics, history, misconceptions, deep learning, and many others from an
  outside perspective. AI isn't scary, and many people have negative views on it
  based on how the media portrays it. Our GBMs will help break this down and explore
  the implications of AI and where it stands today. If you enjoy high level informative
  discussions with your peers, learning more about AI, and meeting new people, GBMs
  is for you!
