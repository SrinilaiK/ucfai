  We invite all of our members and those of you with topics they're passionate about
  to be a part of our Project Teams this semester! We will be hosting a fun, informal
  meeting where everyone is free to write down their interests and ideas, converse
  with other students, and form teams based on the topics pitched. Note: Not everyone's
  idea may make it through, but we encourage you to pitch ideas and by the end of
  the night each of you will be paired in a group based on those interests. Ideas
  will be narrowed down by coordinators who are facilitating this meeting, and the
  teams will be formed with a team leader who will manage and support the project
  throughout the semester. Some project teams will be continuing from last semester!
  Feel free to reach out and join one of our ongoing projects as well.
