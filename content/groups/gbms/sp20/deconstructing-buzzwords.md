  Tonight we'll be encouraging you not to drink the KoolAid and work to demystify
  common terms surrounding Artificial Intelligence. Afterwards we'll have a Q/A (AMA)
  session where members can ask anything they want about the club and its leadership.
  During our Q/A you'll have the opportunity to vote up questions you want answered
  the most.
