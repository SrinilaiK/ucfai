abstract: >-
  We've learned about linear and statistical models as well as different
  training paradigms, but we've yet to think about how it all began. In
  Cognitive Computational Neuroscience, we look at AI and ML from the
  perspective of using them as tools to learn about human cognition, in
  the hopes of building better AI systems, but more importantly, in the
  hopes of better understanding ourselves.
