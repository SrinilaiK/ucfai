# Summarize the Group's content for this semester
summary: >-
  We're continuing to offer most of our Fall 2019 selection, but are giving some
  new topics a try, namely Time Series and Attention. While that means we don't
  cover topics like Computational Cognitive Science this semester, we're
  building out our collection of lecture-workshops. This semester's focus also
  centers around thoroughly developing the interactive components of our  lecture-workshops.
