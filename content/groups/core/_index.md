Our custom lecture series designed to educate newcomers and those looking to 
supplement their studies of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and
Cognitive Science! Here we provide you with intuitions and practical
understandings – enabling you to apply what you learn to research, industry, and
your projects.

The goal of `Core` is to dip your toes into a variety of topics and prepare you
to move into our other, more advanced groups soon after. **We expect you to
attend as many meetings as possible and chunk out a few hours – _roughly 5-10
every week in addition to these meetings_ – to become successful.**

The material here has been the `Core` of AI@UCF since since
{{< mention flxsosa >}}, {{< mention ionlights >}}, and
{{< mention dibaccory >}} reworked the structure of the club at UCF. As the
university doesn't provide such coursework until your final semesters in degree 
programs, we created `Core` as a stand-in, to cultivate your skills for research
and industry before you graduate.
