# Summarize the Group's content for this semester
summary: >-
  This semester we took a step back to broaden our view of machine learning. We looked
  at older (but still capable) statistical tools and incorporated more of the deep
  learning stack to give you the tools to participate in many of the research groups
  at
  UCF and abroad focused on machine learning.
