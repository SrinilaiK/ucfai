  Fully Connect Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks are absolutely wonderful,
  but they miss out on one key component of our world, time. This week we'll look
  at Networks which also model time as part of their inputs â€“ because of this, they'll
  be able to write nearly as well as Shakespeare! ðŸ˜ƒ
