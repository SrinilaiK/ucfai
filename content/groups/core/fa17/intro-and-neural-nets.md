  Welcome back to SIGAI! ðŸ˜ƒ

  Tonight we'll go over some changes that have happened over the summer, how we'll
  handle things after moving forward, then dive into our classic first lecture/workshop
  series, An Intro to Neural Nets. This time, though, we'll go into significantly
  more depth, historically and mathematically, than we have in the past.

  See you there!
