  Hey! This will be our second lecture in Unit 1 on Reinforcement Learning! We'll
  be reviewing what we learned about Markov Decision Processes and then go over
  Dynamic Programming, a method of solving Markov Decision Problems and the theoretical
  foundation for most solutions to modern RL problems.

  Come on out!
