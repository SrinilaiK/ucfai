  We're starting Unit 1 on Reinforcement Learning!

  This is the lecture for that series. Here, we'll cover the problem of learning
  through interaction, what RL is, how it's different from Supervised Learning,
  how RL is formalized (math), and what Markov Decision Processes are Dynamic
  Programming is.

  There is no background knowledge needed for this lecture other than simple arithmetic,
  college algebra, and basic probability theory. We'll be doing a short refresher
  on the necessary concepts if need be ðŸ™‚.

  Hope to see you there!
