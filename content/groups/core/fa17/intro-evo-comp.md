  Hey SIGAI,

  We're beginning our Unit 2 on Advanced Topics with a lecture on evolutionary
  computation by Dr. Annie Wu from UCF's Computer Science Department!

  She'll be giving the introductory lecture she gives to her graduate students
  in her Evolutioanry Computation course here at UCF.

  There will be no slides for this lecture so if you're curious to know, come
  out! It is going to be a great primer for our following lecture on neuroevolution.

  More about Dr. Wu:
  Dr. Wu is the Director of the Evolutionary Computation Lab at UCF and an Associate
  Professor in the Department of Computer Science. Find more here: http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~aswu/
