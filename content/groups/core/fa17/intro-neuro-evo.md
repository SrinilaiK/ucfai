  Welcome to our second to last lecture for Fall 2017!

  We will be giving an introduction to neuroevolution, one of the most active
  subfields in evolutionary computation!

  We will be covering history, prominent algorithms and frameworks, current state-of-the-art
  research going on in the field here at UCF, and the recent attention this field
  has gotten from big names such as Google Brain, DeepMind, FAIR, Uber, MIT, and
  more!
