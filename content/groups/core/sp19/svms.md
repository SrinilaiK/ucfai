abstract: >-
  Support Vector Machines were among the most highly used ML algorithms before
  Neural Nets came back into the foreground. Unlike Neural Nets, SVMs can explain
  themselves quite well and allow us to use these ML mdels in fields like medicine,
  finance, and the like â€“ where regulations require that we can inquire about
  our
  models.
