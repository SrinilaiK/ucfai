  Summary: These notes describe the sparse autoencoder learning algorithm, which
  is one approach to automatically learn features from unlabeled data. In some
  domains, such as computer vision, this approach is not by itself competitive
  with the best hand-engineered features, but the features it can learn do turn
  out to be useful for a range of problems (including ones in audio, text, etc).
