  Abstract: We present an application of back-propagation networks to
  hand-written digit recognition. Minimal preprocessing of the data was
  required, but architecture of the network was highly constrained and
  specifically designed for the task. The input of the network consists of
  normalized images of isolated digits. The method has 1% error rate and
  about a 9% reject rate on zipcode digits provided by the US Postal Service.
