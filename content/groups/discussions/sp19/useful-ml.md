  Abstract: Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform
  important tasks by generalizing from examples. This is often feasible and
  cost-effective where manual programming is not. As more data becomes
  available, more ambitious problems can be tackled. As a result, machine
  learning is widely used in computer science and other fields. However,
  developing successful machine learning applications requires a substantial
  amount of "black art" that is hard to find in textbooks. This article
  summarizes twelve key lessons that machine learning researchers and
  practitioners have learned. These include pitfalls to avoid, important
  issues to focus on, and answers to common questions.
