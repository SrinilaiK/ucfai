  Abstract: Deep learning allows for computational models that are composed of
  multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple
  levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-
  of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object
  detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep
  learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the
  backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its
  internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each
  layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional
  nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech
  and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such
  as text and speech.
