abstract: >-
  Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in
  building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have
  come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as
  object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance
  that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their
  biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ
  from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive
  science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines
  will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they
  learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines
  should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and
  understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems;
  (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to
  support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness
  compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize
  knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and
  promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of
  recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.
