abstract: >-
  Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform important tasks
  by generalizing from examples. This is often feasible and cost-effective
  where manual programming is not. As more data becomes available, more
  ambitious problems can be tackled. As a result, machine learning is widely
  used in computer science and other fields. However, developing successful
  machine learning applications requires a substantial amount of black art
  that is hard to find in textbooks. This article summarizes twelve key
  lessons that machine learning researchers and practitioners have learned.
  These include pitfalls to avoid, important issues to focus on, and answers
  to common questions.
