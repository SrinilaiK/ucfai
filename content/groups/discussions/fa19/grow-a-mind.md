abstract: >-
  In coming to understand the world-in learning concepts, acquiring
  language, and grasping causal relations-our minds make inferences
  that appear to go far beyond the data available. How do we do it?
  This review describes recent approaches to reverse-engineering human
  learning and cognitive development and, in parallel, engineering more
  humanlike machine learning systems. Computational models that perform
  probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured
  representations can address some of the deepest questions about the nature
  and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowledge guide learning
  and reasoning from sparse data? What forms does our knowledge take, across
  different domains and tasks? And how is that abstract knowledge itself
  acquired?
