abstract: >-
  We agree with Lake and colleagues on their list of key ingredients for
  building humanlike intelligence, including the idea that model-based
  reasoning is essential. However, we favor an approach that centers on one
  additional ingredient: autonomy. In particular, we aim toward agents that
  can both build and exploit their own internal models, with minimal human
  hand-engineering. We believe an approach centered on autonomous learning
  has the greatest chance of success as we scale toward real-world
  complexity, tackling domains for which ready-made formal models are not
  available. Here we survey several important examples of the progress that
  has been made toward building autonomous agents with humanlike abilities,
  and highlight some outstanding challenges.
