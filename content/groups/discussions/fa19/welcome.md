abstract: >-
  Welcome to the Intelligence group! This meeting, we'll be discerning
  everyone's research interests, whether passive or active. Following that,
  we'll start narrowing paper topics to fill the 5 unplanned meetings so
  everyone can begin getting a feel for the breadth of computation as a
  field of research.
