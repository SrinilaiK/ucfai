abstract: >-
  Our first non-review paper of the semester will be on using Deep RNNs to perform
  speech recognition tasks. This approach seeks to combine the advantages of deep
  neural networks wtih the "flexible use of long-range context that empowers RNNs".
  The abstract is rather lengthy, so I'll refrain from copying it here. Our weekly  meeting
  on this paper will go over questions from the paper, strategies for reading  more
  complex research papers, and how to identify strengths and weaknesses of journal  articles.
