abstract: >-
  For our first paper in intelligence, we'll be covering how to detect hate speech
  using machine learning algorithms. This is a super interesting topic, because
  hate speech is often hard to define and depends a lot on the context surrounding
  it. This review paper will cover current state-of-the-art approaches for this
  problem.
