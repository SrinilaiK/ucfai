abstract: >-
  This week's paper will investigate a new approach for analyzing psychometric
  qualities from text. Psychometrics, such as emotions or personality traits,
  are often subconsciously conveyed through the manner in which people communicate.
  The authors of the paper propose a new method  for analyzing psychometric qualities
  of authors using a modification of other previously developed architectures
  for natural language processing and analysis.
