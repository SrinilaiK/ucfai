abstract: >-
  The ability to perform a detailed decision-making approach based on  large quantities
  of parameters and data is at the core of the majority of sciences. Traditionally,
  all possible scenarios should be considered, and their outcomes assessed via
  a logical and systematic manner to obtain accurate and applicable methods for
  knowledge discovery. However, such  approach is typically associated with high
  computational complexity. In this article we discuss some requirements of artificial
  intuition and present a model of  artificial intuition that utilises semantic
  networks to improve a decision system.
