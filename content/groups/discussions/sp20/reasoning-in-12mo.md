abstract: >-
  Many organisms can predict future events from the statistics of past experience,  but
  humans also excel at making predictions by pure reasoning-- integrating multiple  sources
  of information, guided by abstract knowledge, to form rational expectations
  about novel situations, never directly experienced. Here, we show that this
  reasoning is surprisingly rich, powerful, and coherent even in preverbal infants.
