abstract: >-
  Piggybacking off our ethics discussion in this week's GBM, we'll be focusing
  on the ethical considerations surrounding use of artificial intelligence in
  therapeutic applications, specificially with respect to aiding current state
  of the art approaches to therapy. Much of the paper discusses surveys and statistics
  of physicians and their attitudes towards technology, and our discussion will
  extend this to address the ethical backdrop for  the topics mentioned.
