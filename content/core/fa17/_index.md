Our custom lecture series designed to educate newcomers and those looking to supplement
their studies of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning! Here we provide you with
intuitions and practical understandings – enabling you to apply what you learn to
research, industry, and your own projects.

The goal of this course is to dip your toes into a variety of topics and prepare you to
move into the other, more advanced, groups soon after. We expect you to attend as many
lectures as possible and chunk out a few hours – roughly 5-10 every week in addition to
these meetings – to become successful.
