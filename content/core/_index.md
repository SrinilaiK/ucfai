Our custom lecture series designed to educate newcomers and those looking to supplement
their studies of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cognitive Science! Here
we provide you with intuitions and practical understandings – enabling you to apply what
you learn to research, industry, and your projects.

The goal of this course is to dip your toes into a variety of topics and prepare you to
move into our other, more advanced groups soon after. **We expect you to attend as many
lectures as possible and chunk out a few hours – _roughly 5-10 every week in addition to
these meetings_ – to become successful.**

The material here has been a part of the core of AI@UCF since {{< mention flxsosa >}},
{{< mention ionlights >}}, and {{< mention thedibaccle >}} reworked the structure of the
club at UCF. As the university doesn't provide such coursework until your final
semesters in degree programs, we created `core` as a stand-in, to cultivate your skills
for research and industry before you graduate.
